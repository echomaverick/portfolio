# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This is a portfolio website template built using Vite.js and Tailwind CSS. With just a few simple steps, you can have your own portfolio up and running in no time.

## Getting Started

To get started follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/echomaverick/portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in your Browser**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the website live!

## Customization

Feel free to customize this template to fit your personal or professional needs. You can modify the content in the `src` directory to update your portfolio items to match your preferences, and extend the functionality by adding more components or pages as needed.

## Deployment

Once you're satisfied with your portfolio, you can deploy it to your preferred hosting platform. You can build the production-ready assets using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized version of your portfolio in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any other hosting service of your choice.
